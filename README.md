# Comunity_website_menshed

Created, developed, and evaluated a community website for the Test Valley Menâ€™s Shed community using PHP, Bootstrap, and MySQL, following the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Integrated user registration, authentication, and a secure invite system, resulting in an intuitive and engaging user experience. Received positive feedback and enhanced community engagement through online surveys.

It was a rewarding experience contributing to the community and creating an intuitive and engaging platform. Looking forward to more exciting projects ahead!
